# 🎬 Netflix Title Classification | Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the **Netflix dataset** to build a predictive model that can classify whether a title is a **Movie** or a **TV Show** based on its features.

## 🔑 Key Steps
- **Data Preprocessing**  
  - Cleaned and structured the Netflix dataset  
  - Handled missing values  
  - Extracted text features from descriptions using **TF-IDF**

- **Feature Engineering**  
  - Combined TF-IDF vectors with other metadata (e.g., release year, duration, genre)  

- **Model Training**  
  - Built classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)  
  - Evaluated model accuracy and performance metrics  

## 📊 Results
- Successfully predicted whether a title is a **Movie or TV Show** with machine learning models.  
- Text-based features (description) played a significant role in improving accuracy.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- TF-IDF (text feature extraction)  
- Jupyter Notebook
